# fault_id
Matlab repository to reproduce the results of my paper on simultaneous identification of systems and faults

# How to run
```
>> init;
>> total_pipeline_2x1_uncont;  % For the first example
>> montecarlo;  % For the Monte-Carlo simulation
```

# Requirements
* [matlab2tikz](https://github.com/matlab2tikz/matlab2tikz) to generate tikz figures (remove code if you do not want to generate tikz)
* Control System Toolbox
* Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

The code was executed and tested in MATLAB Version 23.2.0.2515942 (R2023b) Update 7.
